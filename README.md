## Game Instructions

### General Actions

1. Use `arrow` keys to control the movement of the character
2. Press `Space bar` to open the door, pick up food/baby/keys/trash, etc.
3. Press `D` to drop the baby, go to next line while in conversation with the teenager.

### Find Keys on the Street

When game starts, the player will be first asked to find a blue key and a black key to open the blue and black doors in the game, respectively. The keys may be hidden around the street or bushes in front of the main door. Once the keys are found, press the `Space` key to pick up a key on the ground.

### Kitchen

When interacting with kitchen appliances, the player can pick up or interact with various items by pressing the `space bar`.

1. Pick up meat from the refrigerator.
2. Pick up plates from the kitchen sink.
3. Pick up bread from the bread counter (with a bread toaster on top of it).
4. Pick up shredded lettuce from the counter (with a red cutter on top of it).
All these counters are colored in grey to create a cohesive visual theme.

To add an element of liveliness, instead of using icons, interesting objects on the counters are used as representations for the items. The numbers after each icon represents the number of tasks to be finished during the gameplay.

The stove is used to cook the meat. Press the `space` key to place the uncooked meat on the pan when the player is holding it. The meat has different states: uncooked, fried, and burned (By default, the cooking process from uncooked to fried takes 10 seconds, and from fried to burned takes 5 seconds.  We can adjust the time to increase or decrease the difficulty level.). It should be picked up from the pan before it gets burned. Uncooked or burned meat cannot be used to make burgers.

The player must prepare a certain number of burgers within a limited time to win the game.

>  Hint:
> To make a finished burger, pick up a plate first and place it on an empty blue counter. A finished burger consists of bread, shredded lettuce, and well-cooked meat.

Finally, once the player finishes preparing a burger, the player can deliver the burger to guests waiting in the restaurant area. 50 points will be rewarded for successfully making and delivering a burger.

### Bedroom

The main idea is to pick up the kid and place him/her on the bed as soon as possible. The kid will go back to wandering state on the ground 5 seconds after the kid is placed on the bed. 

Actions involved in the bedroom scene:

1. Pick up the kid when the player gets close to the kid using the `space` key.
2. Carry the kid and get close to the bed and drop the kid on the bed using `D` button. 
3. After 100 seconds the kid is placed on the bed, the kid will go back to the ground and start wandering.
4. The baby will cry after wandering within the baby room for about 90 seconds and this will make come with baby crying sound. Player needs to pick up the baby and place on the bed so the baby will stop crying. Another way to stop the baby from crying is to interact with the teenager and ask him to take care of the baby.

Sucessfully dropping the baby will earn 5 points. If the player interacts with the teenager first and asks him to take care of the baby, all the baby dropping interactions will double the original points (2 x 5 = 10 points) afterwards.

### Laundry

Apart from babysitting, another task that the player can finish is to do laundry. The clothes is placed in a cabinet and player can take it out by pressing the `Space` key. To do the laundry, while holding the clothes, walk into the laundry room and place the clothes into the machine. After the progress bar completed, take it out from the machine and put it back to the closet to earn 15 points.

### Living Room

A teenager walking around in the living room is the one that the player can ask him to help on taking care of the baby so that the baby will stop crying. This interaction will also boost the points earning by placeong the baby on bed. (From 5 points each time to 10 points each time) Other than this, a player can also select another interaction with the teenager ("Teach you how to dance - Press 2"). This interaction will earn 1 point each time.

Other than that, the living room will get trash generated which will potentially hinder the player's movement. The player can press the `Space` key to pick up and clean a trash to earn 1 point. The trash will be generated throughout the entire gameplay. 

### Garden
